# Node Open Weather API

## Description

A simple API wrapper/digester for the Open Weather API written using Express web servers.

It will essentially reverse proxy to the open weather api and return the pertinent/reshaped information.

The endpoint will be `/weather` with query/search parameters `lat` and `lon` for fetching the data.

## Development Tools

I primarily use the bun run time. Tests are written in Jest though to not be locked into a specific runtime.
Regardless, I have a goal that the application should be runtime agnostic and work with node/tsx and bun for versatility purposes.

A Dockerfile and a docker compose file will be included if you'd rather run it in a preconfigured container environment.

This will utilize the `OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY` env var that should be set by you and should be seen in the `.env.example` file.

Outside of speeding up test writing, I've chosen not to use AI amd primarily stuck to just using nvim and basic LSP autocomplete for development.

## Testing

The implementation will include unit tests for utilities with mocked API calls, and e2e tests with mocked API calls.

I'll also included is a bash script that will do unmocked e2e tests using cURL or httpie (if installed) if you have the server running. Be carefuly though because it will use up your API calls.

To run the full test suite use:
```
bun run test
pnpm test
yarn test
npm test
```

## TODO

### Open Weather Client
- [x] the weather condition is outside in that area (snow, rain,etc) 
- [x] whether itâ€™s hot, cold, or moderate outside, we're using Fahrenheit, so <= 55 is cold, >= 85 is hot, and moderate is inbetween.
- [x] whether there are any weather alerts going on in that area and what is going on if there is currently an active alert.

### Web Server
- [x] API endpoint that accepts `lat` and `lon` and returns info

### Tests

#### Unit
- [x] Open Weather Client and Utils

#### E2E
- [x] `GET /weather` (mocked)
- [x] bash script for hitting locally running instance (non-mocked)
